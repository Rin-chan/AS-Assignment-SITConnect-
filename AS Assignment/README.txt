2FA is made using Google Authenticator
Everything else is made by me (Nian Ci) or from the practical notes.

TO USE 2FA:
A 3rd party authentication software is required (such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator). For this assignment, I used Google Authenticator so Microsoft Authenticator may not work.
Scan the QR code or copy the code given into the authenticator app to receive a code.
For future logins, the authenticator app is required to get a code.
